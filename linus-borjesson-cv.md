# Summary

I enjoy being a part of the whole software life cycle, from design and greenfield development to maintenance and refactoring. What I like most is building software that can be reasoned about and trusted.

I am most experienced and comfortable working with back-end, but I have some front-end experience. Similarly, even though it has never been my role I also have some experience with DevOps and CI/CD related work.

# Experience

## Linus Börjesson AB

*November 2021 - present*

In November 2021 I started freelancing. 

### Consultant at Twinfinity AB

*April 2023 - present*

At Twinfinity I've worked with their backend. I've been part of of a team that is responsible for taking raw IFC and DWG files and then parsing them into a useful format for front-end applications. In addition to this I've been involved with authentication and authorization.

While I've mainly worked in backend, I've done some minor frontend related work.

Skills used:
  : C#, Java, DWG, IFC, ODA, TypeScript, OIDC

### Consultant at CPAC Systems AB

*February 2022 - April 2023*

At CPAC Systems I worked with their next generation Android platform. Most of the work consisted of either adapting or extending AOSP.

Skills used:
  : Android, Kotlin, Java, SQLite

### Consultant at Barium AB

*November 2021 - January 2022*

At Barium I worked with back-end development. Most of my work centered on a simple functional programming language used by customers when building applications in Barium's low code platform.

Skills used:
  : Kotlin, PostgreSQL, Functional programming, Docker, Kubernetes

## Acorn Technology AB

*August 2019 - November 2021*

My role at Acorn was as a software developer consultant. I had the same assignment for my whole stay where I worked as a front-end developer for an in-house team at Acorn for Volvo.

### Consultant at Volvo AB

*August 2019 - November 2021*

At Volvo I mostly worked with front-end, developing Volvo's next generation of diagnostic and maintenance tools. The work consisted of building reusable web-components that could be composed into applications.

I also did some back-end and CI/CD work when needed.

Skills used:
  : JavaScript, TypeScript, WebComponents, Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, Azure, Kubernetes, Docker, GraphQL

## WirelessCar AB

*September 2017 - August 2019*

During my time at WirelessCar I worked in back-end, either building micro-services on AWS or helping to develop tools to do so.

One such tool was a framework used together with Spring Boot. The goal of the framework was to standardize and simplify recurring patterns, such as permissions checking, logging etc.

I also worked on a message format and related tooling that in the end was not widely used. The tooling surrounding the message format consisted of code- and documentation-generators.

If nothing else, this made me learn to be aware of the necessity of ownership and requirements. Or, as if often the case, how to navigate the lack of requirements.

Skills used:
  : Java, Spring Boot, Python, PostgreSQL, AWS (DynamoDB, SQS, Lambda, ...), Cryptography, Docker
